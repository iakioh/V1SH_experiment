\section{Introduction} 
% Introduction & background: The Introduction should frame the scientific issues that motivate the study. It should briefly indicate the objectives of the study and provide enough background information to clarify why the study was undertaken and what hypotheses are tested. An overview of the key publications in the field is essential. 

- Scientific issue: How objects recognized and localized? One startegy: localize border between textures. Neural mechanisms?
- \cite{li_can_2000} model: neural circuits in V1 through iso-oriented inhibition and co-linear excitation, see Fig.\ \ref{fig:model}.I
- \cite{popple_testing_2001} experiment: measured border localization inconsistent with bias predicitons by model
-> limited in stimulus duration without visual backward masking -> confounding feedback from higher visual areas \cite{popple_testing_2001, liu_testing_2019, something_about_feedback_speed?}
-> limited in central viewing -> confounding feedback from higher visual areas \cite{zhaoping_feedback_2017}
- objectives of study: 
	1. replicate V1 model
	2. test predictions of model
	3. replicate and adapt experiment for borders in periphery, shown only 20ms with visual backwards masking
	% 4. collect data and compare with model

% - Helmholtz illusion: if so, TODO short literature review on explanations and neural mechanisms of visual size estimation

\section{Methods}
% The Materials & Methods section should be brief but adequate to allow a qualified investigator to repeat the research. The equipment used should be described in detail. All methods of analysis and statistical testing must be identified and explained in detail. 

1. V1 model replication:
- implemented available at \url{https://github.com/iakioh/V1SH_model}
- using Euler method for simulation time of $T = 12 \alpha$ where $\alpha$ denotes membrane time constant, with a typical step size of $\delta t = 0.01 \alpha$
- model parameters as documented for original model \cite{li_neural_1998, zhaoping_understanding_2014}
- exception: orientation-unspecific normalization for excitatory pyramidal cell, following notation with location $i$ and tuned to orientation $\theta$ as 
\begin{equation}
	I_o = 0.85 - 2.0 \left[ \frac{\sum_{j \in S_i} \sum_{\theta'} g_{x}(x_{j\theta'} ) }{C} \right]
\end{equation}
with $C = 16$ following the original implementation, not documentation where $C = \sum_{j \in S_i} 1 = 25$ using a Manhatten grid for sampling visual input
- initial condition: resting state for no visual input (without top-down feedback)
\begin{align}
	y_0 &= I_c / \alpha = 1.0 \\
	x_0 &= \left( I_o - g_y(y_0) \cdot \sum_{\theta'} \psi(\theta') \right) / \alpha = - 1.65
\end{align}

2. predictions:
- border saliency = highest saliency of grid column close, i.e.\ maximally 3 columns distance, to border. Saliency of grid columns = average saliency of all column locations. Saliency of a location = highest (temporally averaged) pyramidal response to inputs at this location. Z-scored over all locations $i$.
- border localization bias = distance between most salient column close to border and actual border, i.e.\ midpoint between textures. Positive if bias towards orientation texture parallel to border, else negative. 
- predict: 
	- lower bias aomplitude and bias sign switch for decreasing number of rows
	- lower saliency and thus lower sensitivity for decreasing number of rows

3. experimental design:
- closely follow \cite{popple_testing_2001}, implemented in PsychoPy \cite{...}
- see Fig.\ \ref{fig:experiment}.I
- ... observers with normal or corrected to normal visual acuity participated. ... naive to its purpose.
- Stimuli generated by and viewed on a HP ProBook 450 G8 Notebook PC ($60$ Hz frame rate), from distance of $60$ cm 
- Text prompt 
	- to press any button to start next trial
	- same location as fixation target appearing after button press
	- framed by white ellipsoid outline of $10°$ width and $5°$ height, remained on screen throughout trial
- Fixation: 
	- "press any button to start next trial" prompt before at same position
	- white circle with diameter of $0.1°$
	- presented for $700$ ms
- Stimulus: 
	- Gabor patches: luminance $l \propto \exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / 2 \sigma^2) \cdot \sin(2 \pi f x)$ from mid-grey background ($x$: displacement from Gabor center along axis of sinusoidal modulation, $y$: along perpendicular axis)
		- $100$\% Mitchell contrast
		- $f = 3$ cpd
		- $\sigma = 0.16°$
		- * size motivated by \cite{popple_testing_2001} scaled up to account for larger receptive fields / lower resolution in the periphery by a factor of $(1 + \frac{e}{e_2}) \approx 4$ (rounded up) for border eccentricity $e = \sqrt{e_x^2 + e_y^2} \approx 11°$ and $e_2 = 3.3°$ \cite{zhaoping_feedback_2017}
	- aranged in square grid texture with spacing of $6 \sigma$
	- number of rows varied randomly between 1 or around 6 (upper texture) and 11 (lower texture) rows extending over the whole screen vertically
	- around 32 columns extending over the whole screen horizontally
	- uniform randomly jittered patch position by up to $\pm 0.6 \sigma$ in vertical and horizontal direction
	- making up two orientation textures vertically separated by $1.72°$
	- in center of each texture was vertical border defined by $90°$ orientation contrast
	- upper and lower textures mirror images of one another, e.g. if upper texture contained vertical patches left of border and horizontal patches right of border, then lower texture contained horizontal patches left of border and vertical patches right of border
	- orienntation of Gabor patches varied randomly between $0°$ vs. $90°$ (vertical vs. horizontal upper right texture)
	- horizontal offset of upper texture relative to lower texture shifted between trials
	- border located in right or left upper peripheral visual field (to avoid any confounding effects of the blind spot), shifted by an eccentricity of approx.\ $\pm10°$ horizontally and $+5°$ vertically from fixation 
	- fixation remained on screen on top of stimulus, as well as ellipsoid outline framing a stimulus exclusion zone to avoid saliently appearing stimuli within central vision
- Mask: 
	- Stimulus presented in this pilot experiment for $100 ms$
	- followed by visual backward mask until subject response
	- = grid of gabor patches of identical position as stimulus, but randomized orientations
- Task: 
 	- indicate on each trial whether upper border left or right of lower border through key press
- Trials: 
	- blocked in 15 minutes by border location in left vs right peripheral field, ... to ... trials per subject and ... trials in total
	- following ... instruction and ... practice trials 
	- horinzontal offsets selected via adaptive staircase procedure: QUEST+ \cite{watson_questplus_2017}, implemented in the questplus package \cite{...}
		- scanned horizontal offsets in $[-3, 3]$ in steps of $0.25$ columns
		- uniform prior
		- cumulative normal likelihood
			$$ \psi(d |\mu, \sigma, \delta) = \delta + (1 - 2 \delta) \int_{-\infty}^{d} \mathcal{N}(x | \mu, \sigma) dx $$
			with $d$ the horizontal offset towards the vertically oriented upper texture, $\mu$ the mean, $\sigma$ the standard deviation, and $\delta$ the symmetric lapse rate
		- posterior over parameters $\mu \in [-2.5, 2.5]$ in steps of $0.25$ columns, $\sigma \in [0.1, 5]$ in steps of $0.1$ columns, and $\delta \in [0, 0.45]$ in steps of $0.05$
		- updated after each trial, horizontal offset selected to maximize expected information gain (minimize expected entropy of posterior after next trial)
		- per block one staircase for each number of rows condition

% 4. data analysis: 
% - pooled all data over left and rigth peripheral field
% - Maximum likelihood fit of responses in dependence of horizontal distance of texture borders with Cumulative Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$
% - PSE -> bias $b = - \mu / 2$, sensitivity $s = 1 / \sigma$
% - Standard deviation $\sigma$ = sensitivity and therefore monotonically dependent on saliency of texture borders
% - Bootstrapping for confidence intervals

\section{Results}
% The Results of the study should be laid out in a series of declarative paragraphs. Only results essential to establish the main points of the work should be included. Often the reporting of the results can be clearer if broken down into subsections. All figures and tables must be cited in the text, and must be numbered in the order of their text citation. Figure legends should be self-explanatory, without referring to the text. They should identify the material that is being illustrated, what is shown, and its significance. Each table should be identified by number and should have a title. The Results section should not include long passages about the rationale of the experiments (which belong in the Introduction), or the methods used (which belong in the Material and Methods), nor should it include justification or discussion of the results (which belong in the Discussion section). 

1. Model replication:
- successful replication of V1 model verified by visualization of all model parameters, including connections, and comparison with expectation and original model \cite{li_neural_1998} as well as replication of 
	- model responses to calibration inputs, see Fig.\ \ref{fig:model}.II,
	- filling-in and avoiding leaking-out \cite{li_computational_2001, zhaoping_understanding_2014}
	- temporal evolution of responses to texture border \cite{zhaoping_understanding_2014}, 
	- the figure ground and medial axis effect \cite{zhaoping_v1_2003, zhaoping_understanding_2014}
	- summation curve for grating disc inputs showing cross-orientation enhancement \cite{zhaoping_v1_2003, zhaoping_understanding_2014},
	- dynamical properties of reduced two-point EI network \cite{li_computational_1998, zhaoping_understanding_2014}

2. Predictions:
- see Fig.\ \ref{fig:experiment}.II, for medium to high input intensities
- for higher number of rows border localization bias positive, i.e.\ towards texture parallel to border, confirming simulation by \cite{li_can_2000}, but negative for lower number of rows; confirming simplified argument by \cite{popple_testing_2001}
- additionally, saliency of border higher for higher number of rows, because for lower rows co-linear excitation of texture vertically oriented to border dominates over iso-oriented inhibition between small number of rows

Top: The model consists of two cell types, excitatory pyramidal cells, which are the in- and output of the model, and inhibitory interneurons. Bottom: Orientation and location of bars depict tuning and receptive field of edge / bar detector neurons in V1.  The excitatory co-linear and inhibitory iso-oriented interactions mediate contextual influences underlying saliency computations in V1. II. Inputs and replicated outputs for model calibration.

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/Figure_2.pdf}
	\caption{Experimental design and predicitions. I. One example trial of the proposed experiment. After subjects fixate for 400 ms, the stimulus with two texture borders of varying horizontal displacement and number of rows is shown in the periphery for 120 ms. Visual backward masking afterwards reduces confounding extrastriatal feedback. Subjects are forced to decide between two alternative choices: is the upper texture border left or right of the lower texture border? II. Predicted saliency and localization of borders given orientation textures of varying height. The absolute value and sign of the x-axis show border saliency (z-scored, here found to be positive for all predictions) and the direction of the localization bias as indicated by the sketched texture border above the y-axis, respectively. The y-axis shows the number of rows of the input texture, with examplatory predicted saliency maps for the case of 3 and 100 rows. For medium to high input intensity and increasing number of rows, the border saliency increases after a sign switch of the border localization bias. Due to wrap-around boundary conditions and an model input size of 100 rows, 100 rows indicates the case of texture ends beyond the visual input field.}

\section{Discussion} 
% Discussion & conclussions: The Discussion should begin with a statement of the important findings of the study. Subsequent sections can address technical issues, analysis of the results, and the implications of the work. Again, it is often helpful to break down the Discussion into subsections that focus on particular topics. It is proper to include a section that summarizes and expands upon conclusions that may be drawn from the work (raises open questions, proposes future studies). 

- important findings:
	- V1 model successfully replicated, with minor improvements to documentation
	- confirmed switch in localization bias and predicted decreased saliency of texture border
	- designed improved experiment to test this prediction
	
- limitations:
	- leaking-out in replicated and original model in dependence of numerical accuracy
	- predictions made for approximate case, not real stimuli
	- missing data collection and analysis 

- implications of the work, open questions / future studies:
	- biases and sensitivity might falsify V1 model explanation -> support alternative neural mechanisms, e.g.\ in higher visual areas % TODO: maybe add additional sources since then!
	- else, assuming visual size estimation consistent with border localization, model predicts visual size illusion inverse to well-known Helmholtz illusion \cite{helmholtz_handbuch_1867}
	- future comparative study of both illusions for new experimental and theoretical avenue to understand contributions of V1 and higher visual areas to visual texture segmentation and size perception
