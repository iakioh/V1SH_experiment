Therewhile you are shown an image with textures. The upper texture has a boundary and the lower texture has a boundary as well. Your task is to decide weather the UPPER boundary is more to the left or the right of the lower texture. If you think that the UPPER boundary is more to the LEFT: press the "left" button. If you think that the UPPER boundary is more to the RIGHT: press the "right" button. Let subject ask questions.
